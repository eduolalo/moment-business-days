moment('30-01-2015', 'DD-MM-YYYY').nextBusinessDay()._d // Mon Feb 02 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST)

**monthBusinessDays()**

Retrieve an array of the business days in the month, each one is a moment object.

```javascript
//Busines days in month January 2015
moment('01-01-2015', 'DD-MM-YYYY').monthBusinessDays()

/*
[ { _isAMomentObject: true,
    _i: '01-01-2015',
    _f: 'DD-MM-YYYY',
    _isUTC: false,
    _pf:{ ... },
    _locale: { ... },
    _d: Thu Jan 01 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST)
  } {
   ...
  },
  ( ... )
]
*/
```

**monthNaturalDays()**

Is like monthBusinessDays(), but this method will include the weekends on it's response.

**monthBusinessWeeks()**

Retrieve an array of arrays, these arrays are the representation of a business weeks and each week (array) have it own business days (Monday to Friday). There could be the case that one week (array) have less than 5 days, this is because the month started on the middle of the week, for example: the first week of January 2015 just have two days, Thursday 1st and Friday 2nd. **Each day in the week arrays are moment objects.**

```javascript
// Business weeks in month January 2015
moment('01-01-2015', 'DD-MM-YYYY').monthBusinessWeeks()

/*
[ [ { _isAMomentObject: true,
      _i: '01-01-2015',
      _f: 'DD-MM-YYYY',
      _isUTC: false,
      _pf: [...],
      _locale: [...],
      _d: Thu Jan 01 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST) 
    }, { _isAMomentObject: true,
      _i: '01-01-2015',
      _f: 'DD-MM-YYYY',
      _isUTC: false,
      _pf: [...],
      _locale: [...],
      _d: Fri Jan 02 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST) }
  ],
  [...]
]
*/
```
**monthNaturalWeeks()**

It's like monthBusinessWeeks(), but this method will include weekends on it's response.

The objects returned by functions are momentjs objects (**except isBusinessDay**) so you can handle it with moment native functions.

**businessDiff()**

Calculate number of business days between dates.

```javascript

var diff = moment('05-15-2017', 'MM-DD-YYYY').businessDiff(moment('05-08-2017','MM-DD-YYYY'));
// diff = 5
